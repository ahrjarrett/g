# Simplified Ghost Dev Environment

### Instructions
1. Run `node -v` to make sure you have Node installed
2. Download or `git clone` this repo and `cd` into it
3. Run `npm install` to install its dev dependencies
4. **Important:** Run `gulp init` only *once* per install
5. Run `nvm use 4.2.3` to switch your version of Node
6. Run `npm start` to spin up server
7. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Note:** If the default Casper theme loads, go to [http://localhost:3000/ghost](http://localhost:3000/ghost), login, and change the theme manually via the “General” tab. You should only need to do this once.
